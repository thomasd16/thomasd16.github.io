			Javascript is slowly but surely taking over everything.
			It is a scripting language that is deployed on nearly every device,
			and can run at speeds comperable to semi-compiled/bytecode languages like Java and C#
		</p>
		<p>
			It's a shame then that it is such a faulty and misunderstood language.
			Unlike rational languages, in order to write well in Javascript you often have to do counter-intuitive and backwards things.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this website I hope to illustrate some of the beautiful and bizarre attributes of the javascript language and its place in the moddern world.
