		<p>Everyone has heard the term anonymous functions vs named functions in javascript however this is 
		a bad way of differentiating them. A better way would be to call them function statements and function literan;
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function bar() {} //function statement
//statement doesent need to have trailing semicolon

var foo = (function () {});//function literal
//notice the trailing semicolon
//wrapping the function in semicolons is not necessary
//but it is good practice</pre>
<p>While appearing similar and functionally looking similar the two act wildly different.
One of them happens to violate causality while the other behaves as a data type.
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
if(false) {
	//defining a function via statement within a loop or condition
	//is illegal in the ECMAScript definition but most browsers will allow you to do so 
	function foo() {
		console.log("foo got called before it was defined");
	}
}
foo();// yep it works</pre>

<p> It gets even wierder </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
foo(); //works!
bar(); //Errors
var bar = (function () {
	console.log("bar got called before it was defined");
});
function foo() {
	console.log("foo got called before it was defined");
}</pre>
<p> Calling literal functions anonymous functions is wrong because they can have names however the name can only be referenced from inside the function itself</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var foo = (function bar() {
	console.log(typeof bar); //logs "function";
});
console.log(typeof foo);//logs "function";
console.log(typeof bar);//logs "undefined";
</pre>
