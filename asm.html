		<p> Asm.js is a subset of javascript designed to allow for near native code execution by adding type hints to normal javascript.
			The basic idea of javascript is to allow for Ahead Of Time compilation of scripts the following is an example of the very basics of asm.js.
			Although Asm.js can be written by hand it is intended to be compiled from C using tools like <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">emscripten</a></p>
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
/* This is the C file to be converted to asm.js */
int add(int a, int b) {
	return int a + b;
}</pre>
<br />
		<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
/*this is the basic asm.js equivalent to the above C function */
function add(a, b) {
	a = a|0; //Applying the OR operator on variables forces them to be an intiger
	b = b|0;
	return a + b | 0;//OR operator specifies return type as int 
}</pre>
<p> Asm.js also allows emulation of a heap and pointers using typed arrays </p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-c">
int addPointers(int *a, int *b) {
	return *a + *b;
}</pre>
<br />
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var MEM32 = new Int32Array(arrayBuffer);
function addPointers(a,b) {
	a = a|0;
	b = b|0;
	return MEM32[a] + MEM32[b] | 0;
}</pre>
<br />
	<h4>What asm.js doesn't support</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>Pointers to variables stored in the stack</li>
		<li>Loading of any library's including Lib C</li>
		<li>Goto Instructions</li>
	</ul>

		Asm.js does create sizable performance boosts. However v8 and IonMonkey are already quite good at optimizing normal javascript as such asm.js is really only useful for including large code bases in your website. (decompression engines, rendering engines ect) Below is the performace increaces in computing the Mandelbrot set using asm.js vs native js.

	<p>While a novel idea, Asm.js lacks practicality. Bringing along libC functions including memory management is wierd since javascript already has that functionality embedded. 
	Furtheremore, despite being almost 2 years old there haven't been any major industrial uses for the project. 
	With javascript already performing on levels close to java and C# efforts should be made to create new large code bases instead of porting existing ones to javascript via compilers.</p>
