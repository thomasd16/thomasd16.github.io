  		<h3> Business </h3>
  		
  		Norway is a great destination for buisnesses due to its robust infrastructure and business friendly tax plans. It's primary exports are what you would expect from a country in its position,  oil products followed closly by fish. Do to its high ranking on development and education indexes there are millions of skilled workers in the country. </p>
  		<p> If you are planing a buisness trip to this fair country there are a few things you should be aware of</p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Roughly 90% of the Norwegion population speaks english to some degree so the language barrier should not be a large issue</li>
  			<li>In Norway primarily first names are used and buisness meetings have a casual air. Last names and titles such as Mister Misses or  Doctor are only used in very formal occasions</li>
  			<li>In Norway people are viewed as individuals. To know someone means being aware of more thatn just what they do professionally. So make sure to get to know your busness contacts out side interests and let them know about yours</li>
  		</ul>
  		Norway also has an unoffical code of conduct that dictates polite behavior in both buisness and social situations. It primaraly has to do with humility. This code is called the Janet Law and best describes values that are important to Norway and other countries on the scandinavian pennisula. The rules of the Janet Law are as follows:
  		<ul>
  			<li>You shall not think you are special. </li>
			<li>You shall not believe you are smarter than others.</li> 
			<li>You shall not believe you are wiser than others. </li>
			<li>You shall not behave as if you are better than others.</li> 
			<li>You shall not believe that you know more than others. </li>
			<li>You shall not believe that you can fix things better than others.</li> 
			<li>You shall not laugh at others. </li>
			<li>You shall not believe that others care about you. </li>
			<li>You shall not believe that you can teach others anything. </li>
